=================================================
 The
 [Modal Python Library](https://modal.com/docs/guide) 
 provides convenient, on-demand access to serverless cloud compute from Python scripts on your local computer.
The
 `Modal`
 itself does not provide any LLMs but only the infrastructure.
 This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with
 `Modal`
 .
[Here](https://modal.com/docs/guide/ex/potus_speech_qanda) 
 is another example how to use LangChain to interact with
