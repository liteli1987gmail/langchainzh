 This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with
 `StochasticAI`
 models.
 You have to get the API\_KEY and the API\_URL
 [here](https://app.stochastic.ai/workspace/profile/settings?tab=profile) 
 .
```
from getpass import getpass
STOCHASTICAI\_API\_KEY = getpass()
```
```
import os
os.environ["STOCHASTICAI\_API\_KEY"] = STOCHASTICAI\_API\_KEY
```
```
YOUR\_API\_URL = getpass()
```
```
from langchain.llms import StochasticAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
```
```
template = """Question: {question}
Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input\_variables=["question"])
```
```
llm = StochasticAI(api\_url=YOUR\_API\_URL)
```
```
llm\_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```
```
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"
llm\_chain.run(question)
```
```
"\n\nStep 1: In 1999, the St. Louis Rams won the Super Bowl.\n\nStep 2: In 1999, Beiber was born.\n\nStep 3: The Rams were in Los Angeles at the time.\n\nStep 4: So they didn't play in the Super Bowl that year.\n"
```
