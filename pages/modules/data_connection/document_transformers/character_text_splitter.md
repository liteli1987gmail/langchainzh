# 以字符拆分

这是最简单的方法。它是基于字符（默认为“\n\n”）进行拆分，并根据字符数来测量块长度。

1. 文本如何拆分：按单个字符。
2. 块大小如何测量：按字符数。

```python
%pip install -qU langchain-text-splitters
```

```python
# 这是一个很长的文档我们可以拆分。
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
```

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    separator="\n\n",
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    length_function=len,
    is_separator_regex=False,
)
```

```python
texts = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(texts[0])
```

    page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.'
    
这是一个将元数据与文档一起传递的示例，注意它是与文档一起分割的。

```python
metadatas = [{"document": 1}, {"document": 2}]
documents = text_splitter.create_documents(
    [state_of_the_union, state_of_the_union], metadatas=metadatas
)
print(documents[0])
```
