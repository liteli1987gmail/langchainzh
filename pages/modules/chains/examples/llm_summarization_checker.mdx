# LLMSummarizationCheckerChain

本教程展示了使用LLMSummarizationCheckerChain处理不同类型文本的一些示例。

它与LLMCheckerChain有一些不同之处，因为它没有对输入文本（或概述）的格式做出任何假设。

此外，由于LLM喜欢在事实检查时产生幻觉或被上下文所困惑，因此多次运行检查器有时是有益的。

这是通过将反向重写的“True”结果反馈给自身，并检查“facts”是否属实来实现的。

从下面的示例中可以看出，这可以非常有效地得出一个普遍真实的文本主体。

您可以通过设置`max_checks`参数来控制检查器运行的次数。

默认值为2，但如果您不想进行双重检查，可以将其设置为1。

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMSummarizationCheckerChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
checker_chain = LLMSummarizationCheckerChain.from_llm(llm, verbose=True, max_checks=2)

• The telescope captured images of galaxies that are over 13 billion years old. This means that the light from these galaxies has been traveling for over 13 billion years to reach us.
