OpenAPI Chain[#](#openapi-chain "Permalink to this headline")
=============================================================

本教程演示了使用OpenAPI链调用自然语言端点并返回自然语言响应的示例。

```
from langchain.tools import OpenAPISpec, APIOperation
from langchain.chains import OpenAPIEndpointChain
from langchain.requests import Requests
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

```

加载规范[#](#load-the-spec "Permalink to this headline")
----------------------------------------------------

加载规范的包装器（以便我们可以更轻松地使用它)。您可以从URL或本地文件加载。

```
spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url("https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docs/")

```

```
Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.  This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.

```

```
# Alternative loading from file
# spec = OpenAPISpec.from_file("openai_openapi.yaml")

```

选择操作[#](#select-the-operation "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------------

为了提供一个专注于模块化链，我们专门为其中一个端点创建了一个链。在这里，我们从指定的端点和方法获取API操作。

```
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/public/openai/v0/products', "get")

```

构建链[#](#construct-the-chain "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------

现在我们可以构建与之交互的链。为了构建这样的链，我们将传入：

- 操作端点

- 请求包装器（可用于处理身份验证等)

- 与之交互的LLM

```
llm = OpenAI() # Load a Language Model

```

```
chain = OpenAPIEndpointChain.from_api_operation(
    operation, 
    llm, 
    requests=Requests(), 
    verbose=True,
    return_intermediate_steps=True # Return request and response text
)

```

```
output = chain("whats the most expensive shirt?")

```

USER_INSTRUCTIONS: "whats the most expensive shirt?"

Your arguments must be plain json provided in a markdown block:

ARGS: ```json
{valid json conforming to API_SCHEMA}
```

Example
-----

ARGS: ```json
{"foo": "bar", "baz": {"qux": "quux"}}
```

The block must be no more than 1 line long, and all arguments must be valid JSON. All string arguments must be wrapped in double quotes.
You MUST strictly comply to the types indicated by the provided schema, including all required args.

If you don't have sufficient information to call the function due to things like requiring specific uuid's, you can reply with the following message:

Message: ```text
Concise response requesting the additional information that would make calling the function successful.
```

You are a helpful AI assistant trained to answer user queries from API responses.
You attempted to call an API, which resulted in:
API_RESPONSE: {"products":[{"name":"Burberry Check Poplin Shirt","url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl10001/3201810981/Clothing/Burberry-Check-Poplin-Shirt/?utm_source=openai&ref-site=openai_plugin","price":"$360.00","attributes":["Material:Cotton","Target Group:Man","Color:Gray,Blue,Beige","Properties:Pockets","Pattern:Checkered"]}]}

USER_COMMENT: "whats the most expensive shirt?"

If the API_RESPONSE can answer the USER_COMMENT respond with the following markdown json block:
Response: ```json
{"response": "Human-understandable synthesis of the API_RESPONSE"}
```

Otherwise respond with the following markdown json block:
Response Error: ```json
{"response": "What you did and a concise statement of the resulting error. If it can be easily fixed, provide a suggestion."}
```

You MUST respond as a markdown json code block. The person you are responding to CANNOT see the API_RESPONSE, so if there is any relevant information there you must include it in your response.

返回原始响应[#](#return-raw-response "链接到此标题的永久链接")
---------------------------------------------

我们也可以运行这个链式操作而不合成响应。这样做的效果就是返回原始的API输出。
