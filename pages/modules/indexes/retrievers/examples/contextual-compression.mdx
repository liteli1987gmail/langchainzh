上下文压缩检索器[#](#contextual-compression-retriever "本标题的永久链接")
=========================================================

本文介绍了DocumentCompressors和ContextualCompressionRetriever的概念。核心思想很简单：给定一个特定的查询，我们应该能够仅返回与该查询相关的文档，以及仅返回相关部分的这些文档。ContextualCompressionsRetriever是另一个检索器的包装器，它迭代基础检索器的初始输出，并过滤和压缩这些初始文档，以便仅返回最相关的信息。

```python
# Helper function for printing docs

def pretty_print_docs(docs):
    print(f"\n{'-' * 100}\n".join([f"Document {i+1}:  " + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)]))

```

使用原始向量存储检索器[#](#using-a-vanilla-vector-store-retriever "本标题的永久链接")
------------------------------------------------------------------

让我们从初始化一个简单的向量存储检索器并存储2023年国情咨文（分块）开始。我们可以看到，给定一个示例问题，我们的检索器返回一个或两个相关文档和一些不相关文档。即使相关文档也有很多不相关的信息。

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

documents = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt').load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
retriever = FAISS.from_documents(texts, OpenAIEmbeddings()).as_retriever()

docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson")
pretty_print_docs(docs)

```

```python
Document 1:

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 2:

A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. 

And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. 

We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  

We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  

We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. 

We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 3:

And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. 

As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. 

While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. 

And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. 

So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  

First, beat the opioid epidemic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 4:

Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. 

And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  

That ends on my watch. 

Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. 

We’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. 

Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  

Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. 

Let’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.

```

使用LLMChainExtractor添加上下文压缩[#](#adding-contextual-compression-with-an-llmchainextractor "本标题的永久链接")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

现在让我们用一个`ContextualCompressionRetriever`包装我们的基础检索器。我们将添加一个`LLMChainExtractor`，它将迭代最初返回的文档，并从每个文档中提取与查询相关的内容。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown")
pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)

```

```python

更多内置压缩器：过滤器[#](#more-built-in-compressors-filters "标题的永久链接")
------------------------------------------------------------

### `LLMChainFilter`[#](#llmchainfilter "标题的永久链接")

`LLMChainFilter`是一个稍微简单但更健壮的压缩器，它使用LLM链来决定最初检索到的文档中哪些要被过滤掉，哪些要被返回，而不操作文档内容。

```python
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainFilter

_filter = LLMChainFilter.from_llm(llm)
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=_filter, base_retriever=retriever)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown")
pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)

```

```

### `EmbeddingsFilter`[#](#embeddingsfilter "标题的永久链接")

对每个检索到的文档进行额外的LLM调用是昂贵且缓慢的。 `EmbeddingsFilter`提供了一种更便宜和更快的选项，通过嵌入文档和查询，并仅返回与查询具有足够相似嵌入的那些文档。

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import EmbeddingsFilter

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
embeddings_filter = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76)
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=embeddings_filter, base_retriever=retriever)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown")
pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)

```

将字符串压缩器和文档转换器连在一起[#](#stringing-compressors-and-document-transformers-together "此标题的永久链接")
==========================================================================================

使用`DocumentCompressorPipeline`，我们还可以轻松地将多个压缩器按顺序组合起来。除了压缩器，我们还可以向管道中添加`BaseDocumentTransformer`，它们不执行任何上下文压缩，只是对一组文档执行一些转换。例如，`TextSplitter`可以用作文档转换器，将文档拆分成较小的片段，`EmbeddingsRedundantFilter`可以用于基于嵌入相似性过滤出冗余文档。

下面我们通过首先将文档拆分成较小的块，然后删除冗余文档，最后基于查询过滤来创建压缩器管道。

```python
from langchain.document_transformers import EmbeddingsRedundantFilter
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import DocumentCompressorPipeline
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=0, separator=". ")
redundant_filter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=embeddings)
relevant_filter = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76)
pipeline_compressor = DocumentCompressorPipeline(
    transformers=[splitter, redundant_filter, relevant_filter]
)

```

```python
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=pipeline_compressor, base_retriever=retriever)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown")
pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)

```
