Deep Lake
===========

> [Deep Lake](https://docs.activeloop.ai/) 是一个多模态的向量存储库，存储嵌入和它们的元数据，包括文本、json、图像、音频、视频等。它会在本地、您的云存储或Activeloop storage上保存数据。 它能执行包括嵌入和它们的属性的混合搜索。

本教程展示了与 `Deep Lake` 相关的基本功能。虽然 `Deep Lake` 可以存储嵌入，但它能够存储任何类型的数据。 它是一个具有版本控制、查询引擎和流式数据加载器的完整的无服务器数据湖，可供深度学习框架使用。

更多信息，请查看深度湖泊 [文档](https://docs.activeloop.ai) 或 [api 文档](https://docs.deeplake.ai)

```python
!pip install openai deeplake tiktoken

```

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake

```

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

```

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

```

在 `./deeplake/` 上本地创建数据集，然后运行相似性搜索。

Deeplake+LangChain的集成在底层使用Deep Lake数据集，因此`dataset`和`vector store`可以互换使用。 


要在自己的云中或Deep Lake存储中创建数据集，请[根据需要调整路径](https://docs.activeloop.ai/storage-and-credentials/storage-options)。

```python
db = DeepLake(dataset_path="./my_deeplake/", embedding_function=embeddings)
db.add_documents(docs)
# or shorter
# db = DeepLake.from_documents(docs, dataset_path="./my_deeplake/", embedding=embeddings, overwrite=True)
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)

```

```python
/home/leo/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/deeplake/util/check_latest_version.py:32: UserWarning: A newer version of deeplake (3.3.2) is available. It's recommended that you update to the latest version using `pip install -U deeplake`.
  warnings.warn(

```

```python
./my_deeplake/ loaded successfully.

```

```python
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

```

Later, you can reload the dataset without recomputing embeddings

```python
db = DeepLake(dataset_path="./my_deeplake/", embedding_function=embeddings, read_only=True)
docs = db.similarity_search(query)

```

```python
./my_deeplake/ loaded successfully.

```



```python
Deep Lake Dataset in ./my_deeplake/ already exists, loading from the storage

```

```python
Dataset(path='./my_deeplake/', read_only=True, tensors=['embedding', 'ids', 'metadata', 'text'])

  tensor     htype     shape      dtype  compression
  -------   -------   -------    -------  -------

   text      text     (42, 1)      str     None   

```

Deep Lake目前是单写多读的。设置 `read_only=True`可帮助避免获取写锁。
