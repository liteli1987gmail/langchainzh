如果您想逐步向VectorStore添加新条目，则最好选择其他选项！

从文本创建VectorStore[#](#create-vectorstore-from-texts "永久链接到此标题")
--------------------------------------------------------------

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Annoy

embeddings_func = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()

```

```python
texts = ["pizza is great", "I love salad", "my car", "a dog"]

# default metric is angular
vector_store = Annoy.from_texts(texts, embeddings_func)

```

```python
# allows for custom annoy parameters, defaults are n_trees=100, n_jobs=-1, metric="angular"
vector_store_v2 = Annoy.from_texts(
    texts, embeddings_func, metric="dot", n_trees=100, n_jobs=1
)

```

```python
vector_store.similarity_search("food", k=3)

```

```python
[Document(page_content='pizza is great', metadata={}),
 Document(page_content='I love salad', metadata={}),
 Document(page_content='my car', metadata={})]

```

```python
# the score is a distance metric, so lower is better
vector_store.similarity_search_with_score("food", k=3)

```

```python
[(Document(page_content='pizza is great', metadata={}), 1.0944390296936035),

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.   Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.   With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.   And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.   Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.   He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.   He met the Ukrainian people.   From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.', metadata={'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'}),

In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.   Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.   Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.   Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.     They keep moving.     And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.     That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.   The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.   It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.', metadata={'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'}),

And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.     We prepared extensively and carefully.   We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.   I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.    We countered Russia’s lies with truth.     And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.

Together with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.   We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.    Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.     We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.    Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.

The Ruble has lost 30% of its value.   The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.   Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.   We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.   And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.    Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.
