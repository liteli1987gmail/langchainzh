Spacy 文本分割器[#](#spacy-text-splitter "跳转至本标题的永久链接")
==================================================

NLTK 的另一种替代方案是使用 Spacy。

- 文本如何被分割：通过 Spacy

- 块大小如何被测量：通过传递的长度函数（默认为字符数）

```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open('../../../state_of_the_union.txt') as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()

```

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import SpacyTextSplitter
text_splitter = SpacyTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)

```

```python
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)
print(texts[0])

```

```python
Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet.

Justices of the Supreme Court.

My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart.

This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents.

But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.

But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.

Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.
