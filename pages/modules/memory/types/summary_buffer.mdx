对话摘要缓存内存[#](#conversationsummarybuffermemory "标题的永久链接")
=======================================================

`ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`结合了前两个想法。它将最近的交互记录缓存在内存中，但不仅仅是完全清除旧的交互，而是将它们编译成一份摘要并同时使用。不过，与之前的实现不同，它使用令牌长度而不是交互数量来确定何时清除交互。

首先让我们了解如何使用这些工具

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI()

```

```python
memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})

```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})

```

```python
{'history': 'System: \nThe human says "hi", and the AI responds with "whats up".\nHuman: not much you\nAI: not much'}

```

我们还可以将历史记录作为消息列表获取（如果您正在使用聊天模型，则此功能很有用)。

```python
memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})

```

我们还可以直接利用`predict_new_summary`方法。

```python
messages = memory.chat_memory.messages
previous_summary = ""
memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary)

```

```python
'\nThe human and AI state that they are not doing much.'

```

在链式中使用[#](#using-in-a-chain "标题的永久链接")
--------------------------------------

让我们通过一个例子来了解，再次设置`verbose=True`，以便我们可以看到提示。

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.
    memory=ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=40),
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")

```

```python
> Entering new ConversationChain chain...

The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

AI:

```

```python
" Hi there! I'm doing great. I'm learning about the latest advances in artificial intelligence. What about you?"

```

```python
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Just working on writing some documentation!")

```

```

```python
' That sounds like a great use of your time. Do you have experience with writing documentation?'

```

```python
# We can see here that there is a summary of the conversation and then some previous interactions
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="For LangChain! Have you heard of it?")

```

```

```python
" No, I haven't heard of LangChain. Can you tell me more about it?"

```

```python
# We can see here that the summary and the buffer are updated
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Haha nope, although a lot of people confuse it for that")

The human then mentioned they were writing documentation, to which the AI responded that it sounded like a great use of their time and asked if they had experience with writing documentation.
Human: For LangChain! Have you heard of it?
AI: No, I haven't heard of LangChain. Can you tell me more about it?
Human: Haha nope, although a lot of people confuse it for that
AI:

```

```python
' Oh, okay. What is LangChain?'

```
