对话缓存窗口内存[#](#conversationbufferwindowmemory "此标题的永久链接")
=======================================================

`ConversationBufferWindowMemory`保留了对话随时间推移的交互列表。它仅使用最后K个交互。这可以用于保持最近交互的滑动窗口，以便缓冲区不会过大。

让我们先探索这种类型内存的基本功能。

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"ouput": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"ouput": "not much"})

```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})

```

```python
{'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}

```

我们也可以将历史记录作为消息列表获取（如果您正在使用聊天模型，则这非常有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"ouput": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"ouput": "not much"})

```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})

```

```python
{'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
  AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}

```

在链中使用[#](#using-in-a-chain "此标题的永久链接")
--------------------------------------

让我们通过一个例子来演示，再次设置`verbose=True`，以便我们可以看到提示。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), 
    # We set a low k=2, to only keep the last 2 interactions in memory
    memory=ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2), 
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")

```

```python
