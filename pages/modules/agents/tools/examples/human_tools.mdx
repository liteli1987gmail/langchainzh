人类AGI工具
=====================

人类具有AGI，因此当AI代理处于困惑状态时，它们可以作为工具来帮助。

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
math_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["human", "llm-math"],
    llm=math_llm,
)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)

```

在上面的代码中，您可以看到工具直接从命令行接收输入。您可以根据需要自定义 `prompt_func` 和 `input_func`（如下所示）。

```python
agent_chain.run("When's my friend Eric's surname?")
# Answer with 'Zhu'

```

```python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
我不知道Eric的姓氏，所以我需要向人类寻求帮助。
行动: 人类
行动输入："Eric的姓氏是什么？"

Eric的姓氏是什么？

```

```python
观察结果: Zhu
想法：我现在知道Eric的姓氏是Zhu。
最终答案：Eric的姓氏是Zhu。

> 完成链式结构。

```

```python
"Eric的姓氏是Zhu。"

```

配置输入函数

默认情况下，`HumanInputRun`工具使用Python的`input`函数从用户处获取输入。您可以自定义`input_func`。例如，如果您想接受多行输入，则可以执行以下操作：

```python
def get_input() -> str:
    print("Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.")
    contents = []
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
        except EOFError:
            break
        if line == "q":
            break
        contents.append(line)
    return "\n".join(contents)

# You can modify the tool when loading
tools = load_tools(
    ["human", "ddg-search"], 
    llm=math_llm,
    input_func=get_input
)

```

```python
# Or you can directly instantiate the tool
from langchain.tools import HumanInputRun

tool = HumanInputRun(input_func=get_input)

```

```python
agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)

```

```python
agent_chain.run("I need help attributing a quote")

```

```python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I should ask a human for guidance
Action: Human
Action Input: "Can you help me attribute a quote?"

Can you help me attribute a quote?
Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.

```

```python
Observation: vini
vidi
vici
Thought:I need to provide more context about the quote
Action: Human
Action Input: "The quote is 'Veni, vidi, vici'"

The quote is 'Veni, vidi, vici'
Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.

```
