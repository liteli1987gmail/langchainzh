PlayWright 浏览器工具包[#](#playwright-browser-toolkit "跳转到标题位置")
===========================================================

该工具包用于与浏览器进行交互。虽然其他工具（如请求工具）对于静态网站来说很好，但浏览器工具包可让您的代理程序浏览网络并与动态呈现的站点进行交互。一些包含在浏览器工具包中的工具包括：

* NavigateTool（navigate_browser）-导航至URL

* NavigateBackTool（previous_page）-等待元素出现

* ClickTool（click_element）-单击元素（由选择器指定）

* ExtractTextTool（extract_text）-使用beautiful soup从当前网页中提取文本

* ExtractHyperlinksTool（extract_hyperlinks）-使用beautiful soup从当前网页中提取超链接

* GetElementsTool（get_elements）-通过CSS选择器选择元素

* CurrentPageTool（current_page）-获取当前页面的URL

```python

# !pip install playwright > /dev/null
# !pip install lxml

# If this is your first time using playwright, you'll have to install a browser executable.
# Running `playwright install` by default installs a chromium browser executable.
# playwright install

```



```python

from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import PlayWrightBrowserToolkit
from langchain.tools.playwright.utils import (
    create_async_playwright_browser,
    create_sync_playwright_browser,# A synchronous browser is available, though it isn't compatible with jupyter.
)

```



```python

# This import is required only for jupyter notebooks, since they have their own eventloop
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

```



实例化浏览器工具包[＃](#instantiating-a-browser-toolkit "此标题的永久链接")
---------------------------------------------------------

始终建议使用`from_browser`方法来实例化，以便

```python

async_browser = create_async_playwright_browser()
toolkit = PlayWrightBrowserToolkit.from_browser(async_browser=async_browser)
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
tools

```

在代理中使用[＃](#use-within-an-agent "此标题的永久链接")
------------------------------------------

其中几个浏览器工具是`StructuredTool`，这意味着它们需要多个参数。这些不兼容（开箱即用）与早于`STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`的代理。

```python

from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) # or any other LLM, e.g., ChatOpenAI(), OpenAI()

agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

```



```python

result = await agent_chain.arun("What are the headers on langchain.com?")
print(result)
