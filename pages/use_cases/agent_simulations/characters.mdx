LangChain中的生成式代理[#](#generative-agents-in-langchain "Permalink to this headline")
===
 
 
本文实现了一种基于文献[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Park， et. al.的生成式代理。
 
 
在这个过程中，我们利用了一个由LangChain检索器支持的时间加权存储对象。
 
 
 
 
 
```python
# Use termcolor to make it easy to colorize the outputs.

!pip install termcolor > /dev/null



```

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)



```

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from typing import List

from termcolor import colored





from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore

from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

from langchain.retrievers import TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever

from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS



```

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
```python
USER_NAME = "Person A" # The name you want to use when interviewing the agent.

LLM = ChatOpenAI(max_tokens=1500) # Can be any LLM you want.



```

 
 
 
 
 
生成式代理记忆组件[#](#generative-agent-memory-components "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------
 
 
本教程重点介绍了生成式代理的记忆及其对行为的影响。记忆在两个方面与标准的LangChain聊天记忆不同：
 
 
1. **记忆形成**
 
 
生成式代理具有扩展的记忆，将多个存储为单个流:
 
 
- 1.观察 - 来自对话或与虚拟世界的交互有关自己或他人的事情
- 2.反思 - 重新涌现和总结核心记忆

2. **记忆召回**
 
 
记忆是通过重要性，最近性和显著性的加权和来检索的。
 


你可以在参考文档中查看以下导入的`GenerativeAgent`和`GenerativeAgentMemory`的定义，重点关注`add_memory`和`summarize_related_memories`方法。




```python

from langchain.experimental.generative_agents import GenerativeAgent, GenerativeAgentMemory



```

记忆生命周期[#](#memory-lifecycle "此标题的永久链接")
---------------




总结上述:中的关键方法`add_memory`和`summarize_related_memories`。




当代理人做出观察时，它会存储记忆:




1. 语言模型评分记忆的重要性（琐事为1，深刻为10）
2. 使用带有`last_accessed_time`的TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever在文档中存储观察和重要性。




当代理人对观察做出响应时:




1. 为检索器生成查询，根据显要性、时效性和重要性提取文档。
2. 概述检索到的信息
3. 更新所使用的文档的`last_accessed_time`。


创建一个生成性人物[#](#create-a-generative-character "此标题的永久链接")
---------------------------



现在我们已经完成了定义，我们将创建两个名为“Tommie”和“Eve”的角色。





```python

import math

import faiss



def relevance_score_fn(score: float) -> float:

 """Return a similarity score on a scale [0, 1]."""

    # This will differ depending on a few things:

    # - the distance / similarity metric used by the VectorStore

    # - the scale of your embeddings (OpenAI's are unit norm. Many others are not!)

    # This function converts the euclidean norm of normalized embeddings

    # (0 is most similar, sqrt(2) most dissimilar)

    # to a similarity function (0 to 1)

    return 1.0 - score / math.sqrt(2)



def create_new_memory_retriever():

 """Create a new vector store retriever unique to the agent."""

    # Define your embedding model

    embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()

    # Initialize the vectorstore as empty

    embedding_size = 1536

    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)

    vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {}, relevance_score_fn=relevance_score_fn)

    return TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=vectorstore, other_score_keys=["importance"], k=15)    



```

```python
tommies_memory = GenerativeAgentMemory(

    llm=LLM,

    memory_retriever=create_new_memory_retriever(),

    verbose=False,

    reflection_threshold=8 # we will give this a relatively low number to show how reflection works

)



tommie = GenerativeAgent(name="Tommie", 

              age=25,

              traits="anxious, likes design, talkative", # You can add more persistent traits here 

              status="looking for a job", # When connected to a virtual world, we can have the characters update their status

              memory_retriever=create_new_memory_retriever(),

              llm=LLM,

              memory=tommies_memory

             )



```


```python
# The current "Summary" of a character can't be made because the agent hasn't made

# any observations yet.

print(tommie.get_summary())



```
```python
Name: Tommie (age: 25)

Innate traits: anxious, likes design, talkative

No information about Tommie's core characteristics is provided in the given statements.



```


```python
# We can add memories directly to the memory object

tommie_observations = [

    "Tommie remembers his dog, Bruno, from when he was a kid",

    "Tommie feels tired from driving so far",

    "Tommie sees the new home",

    "The new neighbors have a cat",

    "The road is noisy at night",

    "Tommie is hungry",

    "Tommie tries to get some rest.",

]

for observation in tommie_observations:

    tommie.memory.add_memory(observation)



```


```python
# Now that Tommie has 'memories', their self-summary is more descriptive, though still rudimentary.

# We will see how this summary updates after more observations to create a more rich description.

print(tommie.get_summary(force_refresh=True))



```
```python
Name: Tommie (age: 25)

Innate traits: anxious, likes design, talkative

Tommie is a person who is observant of his surroundings, has a sentimental side, and experiences basic human needs such as hunger and the need for rest. He also tends to get tired easily and is affected by external factors such as noise from the road or a neighbor's pet.



```

与要求人物的面试前交流
---------------------------


在我们的角色离开我们之前，让我们问他们几个问题。





```python
def interview_agent(agent: GenerativeAgent, message: str) -> str:

 """Help the notebook user interact with the agent."""

    new_message = f"{USER_NAME} says {message}"

    return agent.generate_dialogue_response(new_message)[1]



```


```python
interview_agent(tommie, "What do you like to do?")



```
```python
'Tommie said "I really enjoy design and being creative. I\'ve been working on some personal projects lately. What about you, Person A? What do you like to do?"'



```


```python
interview_agent(tommie, "What are you looking forward to doing today?")



```
```python
'Tommie said "Well, I\'m actually looking for a job right now, so hopefully I can find some job postings online and start applying. How about you, Person A? What\'s on your schedule for today?"'



```


```python
interview_agent(tommie, "What are you most worried about today?")



```
```python
'Tommie said "Honestly, I\'m feeling pretty anxious about finding a job. It\'s been a bit of a struggle lately, but I\'m trying to stay positive and keep searching. How about you, Person A? What worries you?"'



```

当生成智能体相互作用或与虚拟环境相互作用时，会变得更加复杂。以下是 Tommie 和 Eve 之间，的简单对话。





```python

run_conversation(agents, "Tommie said: Hi, Eve. Thanks for agreeing to meet with me today. I have a bunch of questions and am not sure where to start. Maybe you could first share about your experience?")



```
```python
Eve said "Sure, Tommie. I'd be happy to share about my experience. Where would you like me to start?"

Tommie said "That's great, thank you! How about you start by telling me about your previous work experience?"

Eve said "Sure, I'd be happy to share my previous work experience with you. I've worked in a few different industries, including marketing and event planning. What specific questions do you have for me?"

Tommie said "That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about your experience in event planning? I've always been interested in that field."

Eve said "Sure, I'd be happy to share about my experience in event planning. I've worked on a variety of events, from corporate conferences to weddings. One of the biggest challenges I faced was managing multiple vendors and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day of the event. What specific questions do you have?"

Tommie said "That sounds like a lot of responsibility! Can you tell me more about how you handled the challenges that came up during those events?"

Eve said "Sure, Tommie. I'd be happy to share with you how I handled those challenges. One approach that worked well for me was to stay organized and create a detailed timeline for the event. This helped me keep track of all the different tasks that needed to be done and when they needed to be completed. I also made sure to communicate clearly with all the vendors and team members involved in the event to ensure everyone was on the same page. Would you like me to go into more detail?"

Tommie said "Thank you for sharing that with me, Eve. That sounds like a great approach to managing events. Can you tell me more about how you handled any unexpected issues that came up during the events?"

Eve said "Of course, Tommie. One example of an unexpected issue I faced was when one of the vendors didn't show up on time. To handle this, I quickly contacted a backup vendor and was able to get everything back on track. It's always important to have a backup plan in case things don't go as planned. Do you have any other questions about event planning?"

Tommie said "Thank you for sharing that with me, Eve. It's really helpful to hear how you handled unexpected issues like that. Can you give me an example of how you communicated with your team to ensure everyone was on the same page during an event?"

Eve said "Sure, Tommie. One thing I did to ensure everyone was on the same page was to have regular check-ins and meetings with the team leading up to the event. This helped us address any issues or concerns early on and make sure everyone was clear on their roles and responsibilities. Have you ever had to manage a team for an event before?"

Tommie said "That's a great idea, Eve. I haven't had the opportunity to manage a team for an event yet, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for the future. Thank you for sharing your experience with me."

Eve said "Thanks for the opportunity to share my experience, Tommie. It was great meeting with you today."
