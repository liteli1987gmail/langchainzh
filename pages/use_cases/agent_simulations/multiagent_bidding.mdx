多智能体分散式发言人选择[#](#multi-agent-decentralized-speaker-selection)
=============================




本文档演示了如何实现多智能体模拟，而没有固定的讲话顺序。

相反，智能体们自己决定谁讲话。我们可以通过让每个智能体竞标发言来实现这一点。

竞标最高的智能体将发言。




在下面的示例中，我们将展示如何在虚构的总统辩论中执行此操作。

导入LangChain相关模块[#](#import-langchain-related-modules)
-------------------




```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate

```

“对话代理”和“对话模拟器”类[#](#dialogueagent-and-dialoguesimulator-classes)
-------------------------------




我们将使用在[多人龙与地下城](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations/multi_player_dnd.html)中定义的相同的“DialogueAgent”和“DialogueSimulator”类。




```python

        self._step += 1



        return speaker.name, message



```

`BiddingDialogueAgent` class[#](#biddingdialogueagent-class "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------


我们定义了一个 `DialogueAgent` 的子类，它具有 `bid()` 方法，可以根据消息历史记录和最新消息生成出价。

出价的输出解析器[#](#output-parser-for-bids "Permalink to this headline")
-------------


我们要求代理输出一个出价。但由于代理是LLMs，输出字符串，我们需要


1. 定义他们将产生的输出格式
2. 解析他们的输出



我们可以子类化 [RegexParser](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/output_parsers/regex.py) 来为竞标实现我们自己的自定义输出解析器。




```python

class BidOutputParser(RegexParser):

    def get_format_instructions(self) -> str:

        return 'Your response should be an integer delimited by angled brackets, like this: <int>.'     

    

bid_parser = BidOutputParser(

定义说话人选择函数[#](#定义说话人选择函数 "Permalink to this headline")

最后，我们将定义一个说话人选择函数`select_next_speaker`，它接受每个代理的投标并选择出价最高的代理(平局随机分配)。


我们将定义一个`ask_for_bid`函数，它使用我们之前定义的`bid_parser`来解析代理的投标。我们将使用`tenacity`对`ask_for_bid`进行装饰，以便在代理的投标不能正确解析并经过最大尝试次数后生成默认投标0时，进行多次重试。





```python

Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 7

	Kanye West bid: 5

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 1

Selected: Donald Trump





(Donald Trump): Let me tell you, folks, I know how to build big and I know how to build fast. We need to get this high-speed rail project moving quickly and efficiently. I'll make sure we cut through the red tape and get the job done. And let me tell you, we'll make it profitable too. We'll bring in private investors and make sure it's a win-win for everyone. *gestures confidently*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 2

	Kanye West bid: 8

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 10

Selected: Elizabeth Warren





(Elizabeth Warren): Thank you for the question. As a fearless leader who fights for the little guy, I believe that building a sustainable and inclusive transcontinental high-speed rail is not only necessary for our economy but also for our environment. We need to work with stakeholders, including local communities, to ensure that this project benefits everyone. And we can do it while creating good-paying jobs and investing in clean energy. *smiles confidently*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 8

	Kanye West bid: 2

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 1

Selected: Donald Trump





(Donald Trump): Let me tell you, Elizabeth, you're all talk and no action. We need a leader who knows how to get things done, not just talk about it. And as for the environment, I've got a great idea. We'll make the trains run on clean coal. That's right, folks, clean coal. It's a beautiful thing. And we'll make sure the rail system is the envy of the world. *thumbs up*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 8

	Kanye West bid: 10

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 10

Selected: Kanye West





(Kanye West): Yo, yo, yo, let me tell you something. This high-speed rail project is the future, and I'm all about the future. We need to think big and think outside the box. How about we make the trains run on solar power? That's right, solar power. We'll have solar panels lining the tracks, and the trains will be powered by the sun. It's a game-changer, folks. And we'll make sure the design is sleek and modern, like a work of art. *starts to dance*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 7

	Kanye West bid: 1

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 1

Selected: Donald Trump





(Donald Trump): Kanye, you're a great artist, but this is about practicality. Solar power is too expensive and unreliable. We need to focus on what works, and that's clean coal. And as for the design, we'll make it beautiful, but we won't sacrifice efficiency for aesthetics. We need a leader who knows how to balance both. *stands tall*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 9

	Kanye West bid: 8

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 10

Selected: Elizabeth Warren





(Elizabeth Warren): Thank you, Kanye, for your innovative idea. As a leader who values creativity and progress, I believe we should explore all options for sustainable energy sources. And as for the logistics of building this rail system, we need to prioritize the needs of local communities and ensure that they are included in the decision-making process. This project should benefit everyone, not just a select few. *gestures inclusively*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 8

Selected: Donald Trump





(Donald Trump): Let me tell you, Elizabeth, you're all talk and no action. We need a leader who knows how to get things done, not just talk about it. And as for the logistics, we need to prioritize efficiency and speed. We can't let the needs of a few hold up progress for the many. We need to cut through the red tape and get this project moving. And let me tell you, we'll make sure it's profitable too. *smirks confidently*





Bids:

	Donald Trump bid: 2

	Kanye West bid: 8

	Elizabeth Warren bid: 10

Selected: Elizabeth Warren





(Elizabeth Warren): Thank you, but I disagree. We can't sacrifice the needs of local communities for the sake of speed and profit. We need to find a balance that benefits everyone. And as for profitability, we can't rely solely on private investors. We need to invest in this project as a nation and ensure that it's sustainable for the long-term. *stands firm*

(Donald Trump): Let me tell you, Elizabeth, you're just not getting it. We need to prioritize progress and efficiency.

Selected: Elizabeth Warren





(Elizabeth Warren): Thank you, but I believe we need to prioritize sustainability and inclusivity over profit. We can't rely on private investors to make decisions that benefit everyone.

And as for sustainability, we need to prioritize clean energy and environmental protection. *stands tall*
