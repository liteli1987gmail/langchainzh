BabyAGI with Tools[#](#babyagi-with-tools "Permalink to this headline")
===========


本笔记基于[baby agi](baby_agi.html)，演示了如何替换执行链。之前的执行链仅仅是使用了一个LLM模型进行了猜测。通过替换一个可以访问工具的代理来执行链，我们希望能够得到可靠的信息。



安装和导入所需的模块[#](#install-and-import-required-modules "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------





```python
import os

from collections import deque

from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any



from langchain import LLMChain, OpenAI, PromptTemplate

from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

from langchain.llms import BaseLLM

from langchain.vectorstores.base import VectorStore

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from langchain.chains.base import Chain

from langchain.experimental import BabyAGI



```

连接到向量存储库[#](#connect-to-the-vector-store "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------


具体步骤取决于使用的向量存储库。





```python
%pip install faiss-cpu > /dev/null

%pip install google-search-results > /dev/null

from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore



```
```python
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.

Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.



```


```python
# Define your embedding model

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Initialize the vectorstore as empty

import faiss



embedding_size = 1536

index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)

vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})



```

定义链[#](#define-the-chains "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------


BabyAGI 依赖三个LLM链:


* 任务创建链用于选择要添加到列表中的新任务
* 任务优先级链，用于重新确定任务的优先级
* 执行连执行任务的链




注意：在这个文档中，执行链将会变成一个代理。




```python

from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor

from langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChain



todo_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(

    "You are a planner who is an expert at coming up with a todo list for a given objective. Come up with a todo list for this objective: {objective}"

)

todo_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=todo_prompt)

search = SerpAPIWrapper()

tools = [

    Tool(

        name="Search",

        func=search.run,

        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",

    ),

    Tool(

        name="TODO",

        func=todo_chain.run,

        description="useful for when you need to come up with todo lists. Input: an objective to create a todo list for. Output: a todo list for that objective. Please be very clear what the objective is!",

    ),

]





prefix = """You are an AI who performs one task based on the following objective: {objective}. Take into account these previously completed tasks: {context}."""

suffix = """Question: {task}

{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(

    tools,

    prefix=prefix,

    suffix=suffix,

    input_variables=["objective", "task", "context", "agent_scratchpad"],

)



```



```python

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]

agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=tool_names)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(

    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True

)



```





### 运行BabyAGI [#](#run-the-babyagi“此标题的永久链接”）




现在是时候创建BabyAGI控制器并观察它尝试完成您的目标。




```python

OBJECTIVE = "Write a weather report for SF today"



```



```python

# Logging of LLMChains

verbose = False

# If None, will keep on going forever

max_iterations: Optional[int] = 3

baby_agi = BabyAGI.from_llm(

    llm=llm, vectorstore=vectorstore, task_execution_chain=agent_executor, verbose=verbose, max_iterations=max_iterations

)



```



```python

baby_agi({"objective": OBJECTIVE})



```





```python
